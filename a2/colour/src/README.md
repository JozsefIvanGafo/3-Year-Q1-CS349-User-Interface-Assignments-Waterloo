Description: 
The project is divided in different folders. 
The main.ts is located in source, 
in the folder containers we can find all custom containers modules created for this projects, 
in the folder layout we have custom layouts modules for the containers ,
in custom buttons we have different modules for custom buttons or text field
in mvc we find the observer and model to program using mvc.

Use of chat gpt:
I use chat gpt for making a part of the custom central layout ts (is commented on the code which part I use the help of chat gpt)

Bug:
The text field of lum it has a border in black and it doesn't change if you set border="", so I leave it like that.
The position of hue text field and label are slightly shifted compared to the other 2.

Warnings:
There are 2 warning in right_layout.ts and custom_central_layout.ts because I didn't use boundsHeight, and if I remove it I receive an error. SO I leave it as it is.
